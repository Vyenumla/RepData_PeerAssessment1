## Set up working directory
```{r, echo=TRUE}
setwd("~/R training/Repro Res/RepData_PeerAssessment1")
dir() # check the files in working dir
```
## load standard libraries
```{r, echo=TRUE}
## load libraries----

library(dplyr)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
##library(tidyverse)

```

## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r, echo=TRUE}
activity <- read.csv("./activity/activity.csv")
str(activity)
head(activity)
```
### Calculate total steps for each day

```{r, echo=TRUE}
histo <- activity %>%
                group_by(date) %>%
                        summarize(total = sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
histo
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
